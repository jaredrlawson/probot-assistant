ProBot Assistant lets you add an interactive chat bubble to your site with:

- 🟢 Floating chat bubble (left/right) with **pulse halo** and teaser toast
- 🟢 JSON-driven knowledge base (packaged or manual upload)
- 🟢 Manual Q/A editor with Import/Export in WP Admin
- 🟢 Fuzzy matching (adjustable threshold)
- 🟢 Greeting with typing delay effect
- 🟢 Sound notifications (toggleable)
- 🟢 **Mobile-first fullscreen** on phones, **desktop popup** on larger screens
- 🟢 Color customization (bubble, halo, panel, toast) via pickers or CSS vars
- 🟢 Halo & pulse intensity sliders
- 🟢 Built-in GitHub self-updater (release-based)
- 🟢 Article Writer **preview** (1.6.0 full rollout planned)

Perfect for customer support, FAQs, lead gen, and beyond.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I put my intents? =
Go to **ProBot Assistant → Knowledge Base**. Choose **Packaged** (ships with the plugin) or **Manual** (paste/edit JSON). You can import/export JSON from there.

= Does it need an API key? =
No for the base plugin. Option fields exist for future add-ons (e.g., OpenAI fallback) but they’re optional.

= Can I customize colors? =
Yes. Use the native color pickers or paste values (hex/RGB/RGBA). You can also tweak advanced CSS variables if you want deeper styling.
